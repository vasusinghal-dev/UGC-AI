### Data Flow - Image Generation

1. User uploads 2 images (product + person)
2. Backend validates and deducts credits (5 credits per generation)
3. Images are uploaded to Cloudinary
4. A project scaffold is created with uploaded images and saved to the database (isGenerating = true)
5. AI model generates a combined image
6. Generated image uploaded to Cloudinary
7. Project is updated with the generated image and status (isGenerating = false)
8. If generation fails, credits are refunded and project is updated with error-state and status (isGenerating = false)

### Data Flow - Video Generation

1. User requests video generation for an existing project
2. Backend validates and deducts credits (10 credits per generation)
3. Project is locked (isGenerating = true) to prevent duplicate generation
4. AI service generates video using generated image as base
5. Generated video is downloaded temporarily to local storage
6. Video is uploaded to Cloudinary
7. Project is updated with generatedVideo URL and status (isGenerating = false)
8. Temporary video file is deleted from local storage
9. If generation fails, credits are refunded and project is updated with error-state and status (isGenerating = false)
